Welcome to poisepms

This project consists of 4 tables. The project table, the customer table, the contractor table and the architect table.
This project will ask the user what they would like to do to the database and depending on what the user requests and information provided, this project will execute each given request.

To get started with this project is really simple. The original tables will be displayed first followed by a question asking what the user would like to do, after that question has been answered the project will execute the users commands.

If there are any dificulties the user can get help from myself.

The project is maintained my myself, Adrian Jensen.
